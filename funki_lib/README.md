# Funki Lang

Funki is a embeddable functional customisable langauge.

It is currently in Alpha. Much of the language is still open to being changed
and has not be finalised.

Funki is open to contributions.

Funki is built on Lalrpop.

It currently supports:

- Custom types
- Custom operators
- Custom functions
- Integer arithmetic
- String interpolation
- Closures
- Error messages and locations
- More!

Changes that need to be made:

- Language design is still subject to change
- Move to stack based interpretation rather than recursive
- Full language documentation/ tutorials
